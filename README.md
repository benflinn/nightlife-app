# NightPlan

A web app to help you plan your evening!

Enter your city name or zip code, and NightPlan will return several local bars, with pictures and links to their website.

Unauthenticated users can view all bars in their area.

Authenicated users can add or remove themselves to a bar.

NightPlan uses the Foursquare API for local bars, images, and links.

This project is part of Free Code Camp's Basejump curriculum.
